# ProjectGoLive (Inventory Tracker)

## Capstone project of GoSchool

Picture this:
A friend gives you a box of muffin, you chuck it in the fridge and accidentally forgets about it as you are busy.
A week later and suddenly you have a midnight craving, only to reach into your fridge and find a box of expired muffins.
Either you risk having stomachache or it's another box of muffin thrown and wasted in the bin.
